# Let down some pigeons
##### A 2D platformer game made by me and @Fazom
Here, a pigeon needs to go forward, to jump by time. When the timer ends, it stops and needs to **calibrate** and shoot.
This game was created as an experiment as we wanted to finish just one game.
It is now published in Google Play. The link can be fount in **Projects** tab
